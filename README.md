# Mobile-Angular-App-2do

I got the Icon online from a google search then used a tool to generate the different versions for different devices
I am using partials with URLTemplate from ngRoute module so if testing in browser it needs to be on a server to serve the html files.
I considered using an inline template but I thought it would just make things less readable.
